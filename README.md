## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **Git** to clone the repository  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## ðŸ“¦ Project Setup

`git clone https://github.com/Siddhant-awati/FileStatusGrid.git`

### 2. Navigate to the project folder

`cd FileStatusGrid`

### 3. Install dependencies

`npm install`

### 4. Start the development server

`npm run dev`

### 5. Open the application

`Visit http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.`

## âœ… Requirements Implemented

- âœ” **Only files with a status of `"available"` can be downloaded.**

- âœ” **Select-all checkbox behavior:**

  - Unselected if no items are selected
  - Selected if all items are selected
  - Indeterminate if some but not all items are selected

- âœ” **"Selected X" text updates dynamically**, showing `"None Selected"` when nothing is selected.

- âœ” **Clicking the select-all checkbox:**

  - Selects all items if none or some are selected
  - De-selects all items if all are selected

- âœ” **Clicking "Download Selected" triggers an alert** listing the path and device of all selected files.

- âœ” **Rows change color on hover and when selected**
  - Only `available` rows show hover effect and rest rows are disabled

## ðŸ“Œ Assumptions & Considerations

1. **API Data Simulation**

   - The table component is assumed to consume data from an API call.
   - Mocked data is used to simulate the API response:  
     `public/mock-data/files.json`

2. **Pagination Logic**
   - Pagination is implemented when the number of records exceeds 10.
   - To test pagination,
     Modify `Home.tsx` (`src/pages/Home.tsx`).  
     update the URL variable to:  
      `const URL = "/mock-data/files-pages.json";`
